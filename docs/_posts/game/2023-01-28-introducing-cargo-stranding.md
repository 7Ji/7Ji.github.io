Ever since getting Death Stranding for free on Epic, I've enjoyed it exclusively on VeryHard through and through. And because of my hobby in 100% every game, I've spent a lot of the time to reconstruct the route and zip-line network, and mostly contributing 100% the material for every structure.  
自从我在Epic上白嫖到死亡搁浅以后，我就在最高难度下嗯送快递。而且因为我喜好100%，我花了大量的时间在重建公路和索道上，并且基本对每个建筑都贡献100%的材料。


This, however, leads to a painful experience since I want, need and am forced to squeeze the value out of every single material, and there's no good calculator for the tasks. Yes, there ARE calculators, but most of them can only do the math for a single request, or single for every kind of material. What I want is to calculate multiple requests, so I could bring a whole truck load of materials and finish a big chunk of the map in one go.  
不过，因为我想、需要、也被迫要压榨每一个材料的价值，体验可以说十分痛苦，而且也没有现成的帮忙的计算器。确实，有死亡搁浅的计算器，不过大多数都只能对单一材料需求做计算，或者一次做每一种类的材料。我想要的是计算多个请求，从而能带一整卡车的材料，一趟就修完一大块地图。

So, also as a practice for my C++ and Javascript skill, I've written two seperate calculators. One in C++, completely CLI, better in performance, and another one in HTML+CSS+Javascript, easier to get.  
因此，也作为练习C++和Javascript，我分别写了两个计算器。一个完全命令行操作的C++写的，性能更强；另一个HTML+CSS+Javascript写的，能更简单地取得

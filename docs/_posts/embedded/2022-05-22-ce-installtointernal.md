The method documented here is outdated and will possibly cause damange to your device (i.e. brick it) and even break your current existing CE/EE installation that the installation steps should be running on. It's deleted to avoid misuse.

Please refer to the documentation of ampart, and the other documentations here on the blog (e.g. installation of ArchLinuxARM) to learn how to set up a bootable system on eMMC on Amlogic devices from ground up, so you can then easily utilize those knowledge and ampart to install CE/EE.
